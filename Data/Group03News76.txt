CONTINENTAL ROCK Bentley Continental GT Speed from private collection of Sir Elton John to sell for only £80,000
The high-powered Continental GT has a blistering top speed of 205mph -  and it will go under the hammer for a bargain price
A LUXURY motor straight from the private collection of Sir Elton John has emerged for sale for just £80,000.
The 2014 Bentley Continental GT Speed was bought from new by the musician, before being handed over to his partner in 2015.
The car has been in David Furnish's name since April 2015, and has remained in the couple's private collection for the last four years.
The GT Speed is the most impressive of the Continental series.
It boasts a 6.0-litre W12 engine, capable of producing 626bhp - slightly more than a McLaren F1 when it was first launched.
And the brilliant coupe can accelerate from 0-60mph in 3.9 seconds, with a top speed of 205mph.
Finished in Onyx Black and sitting on 21-inch alloy wheels, the car also comes with a number of Sir Elton’s personally selected options - creating a list so long it stretches across three A4 pages.
And the Bentley has covered under 22,000 miles in the hands of its two well-known owners.
The car is due to go up for sale with Silverstone Auctions at their Classic sale on July 21-22.
