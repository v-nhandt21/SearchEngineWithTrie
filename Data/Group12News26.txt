‘There Are a Lot of Things We Can Do’
Jimmy Kimmel, a son of Las Vegas, delivered one of the most emotionally searing monologues in his 
show’s 14-year history on Monday as he honored those killed and injured in Sunday night’s shooting, 
and challenged President Trump and Congress to act against gun violence. Just as he did in his 
attacks on the Republican health care bills this year, Mr. Kimmel used plain, pointed language 
while acting as a social conscience as he called out politicians, the National Rifle Association 
and complacent citizens.
Choked up from the start, he ultimately broke into tears as he related the events and the aftermath 
of what was one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history.
“This morning, we have children without parents and fathers without sons, mothers without daughters. 
We lost two police officers. We lost a nurse from Tennessee. A special-ed teacher from a local 
school here in Manhattan Beach. It’s the kind of thing that makes you want to throw up or give up. 
It’s too much to even process — all these devastated families who now have to live with this pain 
forever because one person with a violent and insane voice in his head managed to stockpile a 
collection of high-powered rifles and use them to shoot people.” — JIMMY KIMMEL
