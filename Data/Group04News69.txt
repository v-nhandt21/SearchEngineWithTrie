Chris Pratt shared the Bible’s message of hope and redemption Monday night at the MTV Awards.
In his acceptance speech for the 2018 Generation Award, the “Jurassic World” star talked about his nine rules for life, mixing the comedic, “Don’t be a turd,” with the profound, “Learn to pray.”
“Number six, God is real, God loves you, God wants the best for you, believe that,” Mr. Pratt said. “I do.”
His final rule was to remember that “nobody is perfect.”
“People are going to tell you you’re perfect just the way you are,” he said. “You’re not. You are imperfect. You always will be. But there is a powerful force that designed you that way, and if you’re willing to accept that, you will have grace, and grace is a gift. And like the freedom we enjoy in this country, that grace was paid for with somebody else’s blood. Do not forget it. Do not take it for granted.”
Other rules included, “You have a soul, be careful with it”; “Doesn’t matter what it is, earn it”; and “When giving a dog medicine, put the medicine in little pieces of hamburger — they won’t even know they’re eating medicine.”
Of rule number eight, “Learn to pray,” Mr. Pratt said: “It’s easy, and it’s good for your soul.”
Mr. Pratt, 38, stars in Marvel Studios’ “Guardians of the Galaxy” series. He has been outspoken about his faith and his calling to spread the Gospel through his celebrity.
The actor said he came to faith when he was 19 years old, when a stranger approached him in the parking lot of a grocery store.
“He was like, ‘I stopped you because Jesus told me to stop and talk to you,’ ” Mr. Pratt recalled in an interview with Esquire. ” ‘He said to tell you you’re destined for great things.’ “
Mr. Pratt later got his big break while waiting tables at the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co., where a director spotted him and encouraged him to become an actor.
