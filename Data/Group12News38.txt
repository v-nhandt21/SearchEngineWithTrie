My Whole Heart Is There
Yeni González left her home in rural Guatemala in mid-May. Days later, she crossed the United States 
border, by night, with her three young children. They were picked up by Border Patrol, she said, 
and taken to a detention center near Yuma, Ariz.  
At 5 one morning, agents woke the children there and took them away. 
Ms. González’s children  — Deyuin, Jamelin and Lester — are among more than 2,000 young migrants 
who were separated from their adult relatives under the Trump Administration’s “zero-tolerance” 
policy. 
Despite President Trump’s executive order ending separations and a judge’s order calling on federal 
authorities to put families back together in no more than 30 days, most families have not been 
reunited. This week, Ms. González’s family became the rare exception.
“New York,” she said in Spanish when she spotted the skyline from a car. “My whole heart is there.”
While she was held in detention centers in Arizona, Deyuin, Jamelin and Lester were sent to a 
shelter in New York, along with more than 300 children. Children separated at the border were 
scattered across 17 states.
Ms. González cannot yet retrieve her children because of a long list of requirements from the 
federal government, but she saw them again on Tuesday, after more than five weeks apart.
