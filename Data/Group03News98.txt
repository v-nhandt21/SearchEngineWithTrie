POWER HUNGRY Apple’s ‘supercharger’ revealed in leak – new plug promises 30% FASTER iPhone charging
IPHONE owners could soon get a fast charger that powers up the handset 30 percent quicker.
Leaked images of a prototype 18-watt Apple USB-C plug have appeared online that will apparently ship with Apple's next handset.
If accurate, this will allow iPhone users to take advantage of the device's fast-charging perk without spending extra on accessories or resorting to hacks.
The pics are fresh off the Apple supply chain and show the all-white design of the new charger and a USB-C connector hole on the back.
This is where the USB-C to lightning cable will go, according to multiple reports that claim Apple isn't switching to USB-C connectors like the ones supported by its MacBook line.
Rumblings of an Apple shift to USB-C have been gaining traction this month.
An earlier tip suggested that the tech giant was getting ready to dump the lightning port it introduced in 2012 for a USB-C port on new iPhones.
But these new leaks don't offer any concrete proof of that. And worst case scenario: they could just show a copycat charger that isn't the real deal.
USB-C is an increasingly popular type of charging and data transfer port that was launched in the middle of 2014.
The male end of the cable is a little thicker and much wider than Apple's Lightning cables, but they largely perform the same job.
However, while Lightning ports are exclusively used on Apple devices, USB-C ports are now very common.
Most flagship Android phones now feature USB-C ports, including the Samsung Galaxy S9, Google Pixel 2, and OnePlus 6.
