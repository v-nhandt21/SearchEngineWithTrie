ON YER BIKE Motorists face fresh police crackdown if they drive this close to cyclists
Plans to be announced by Transport Minister Jesse Norman following Government review into bike safety
AGGRESSIVE motorists who drive too close to cyclists will be targeted in a new police crackdown to make roads safer for bike users.
The Department for Transport hopes £500k of funding for a new safety scheme will encourage more people to use bikes for short journeys and reduce the number of accidents.
Some police forces have already began to impose £100 fines and three penalty points for drivers caught passing less than 1.5m from bikes.
Transport Minister Jesse Norman will announce today that other forces will be trained to ensure “more drivers are made aware of the need to leave safe distances when overtaking cyclists”, The Times reports.
The initiative, which follows a Government review into cycling - will also see learner drivers given extra tuition so they can pass cyclists safely.
Speaking at a cycling conference in Manchester today Mr Norman will say: “The benefits of cycling and walking are enormous.
“We shouldn’t only concentrate on catching and punishing drivers when they make a mistake but try to ensure that they have the skills and knowledge to drive safely alongside cyclists in all conditions.”
The Highway Code currently doesn’t state a minimum distance between cars and bikes and only instructs drivers to give ''plenty of room''.
Many other countries have introduced passing distances with gaps of at least a metre on local roads and 1.5m on faster routes.
West Midlands And Cambridgeshire police are two of the forces already targeting drivers who pass too close.
The Department for Transport are currently consulting on whether to introduce a minimum distance for overtaking cyclists.
