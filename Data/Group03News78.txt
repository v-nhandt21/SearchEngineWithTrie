SNOOZE CRUISE Motorists could ‘watch films and sleep’ behind the wheel in driverless cars by 2021, Volvo claims
MOTORISTS could be able to "watch a movie or sleep" behind the wheel from 2021, according to a Volvo executive.
The Swedish manufacturer has claimed their driverless technology will  be ready for drivers to perform other tasks while on the road within the next three years.
Henrik Green, Volvo's Senior Vice President of Research and Development, told Jalopnik the company's driverless system would allow motorists “to eat, sleep, work, watch a movie, relax or do whatever".
The system would allegedly be available for the marquee's next generation of XC90 SUVs, and would operate on Level 4 autonomy - meaning no driver intervention is required.
But the system wouldn't work on just any road.
According to Green, Volvo's technology would only apply to major motorways, using mapping and laser technology to navigate the high-speed roads.
The manufacturer has labelled their technology "Highway Pilot", and it's expected to be offered as a premium add-on with a "four-figure" value.
Green's claims come as a surprise considering Volvo's announcement late last year that they would be delaying their driverless trials for up to four years. 
The company had allegedly run into problems with their fleet of fully autonomous motors, and would not be testing the technology until at least 2021.
