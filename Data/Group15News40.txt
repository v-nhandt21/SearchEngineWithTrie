Is Britain off the hook? Donald Trump ‘mistakenly blames Canada for White House fire of 1814’


It is a moment etched into America’s collective memory – when Britain took a torch to the White House in 1814. 

But according a private conversation which leaked to CNN, Donald Trump thinks another close ally was behind the famous blaze. 

The US president reportedly blamed Canada for the fire in a testy phone call this week about his new tariffs with Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister. 

Mr Trudeau has opposed Mr Trump’s steel and aluminium sanctions and questioned America’s claim that they are needed in the interests of national security. 

Rebuffing the criticism down the line, Mr Trump reportedly shot back: “Didn't you guys burn down the White House?"

The historical faux pas could be explained by the fact that the act was in retaliation to America’s attack on York, Ontario – a British colony that eventually became Canada. 

It is not the first time details of the infamous White House fire have been mistaken by contemporary politicians looking to score points.

Earlier this year Emmanuel Macron, the French president, made a joke about the White House being  “burned down in 1815” during his visit to Washington, according to an official briefing.  It actually took place a year earlier. 

Similarly in May when Sir Kim Darroch, the UK ambassador to Washington, tweeted about the role Britain played in building the White House, his French counterpart shot back: “And in the burning of it in 1815…”

Mr Darroch responded: “I was wondering who would be the first to say that. But Gerard, unusually, your history is a little inaccurate. It was 1814.”

Another Twitter user commented: "And Britain with the BURN. #waterloo."
