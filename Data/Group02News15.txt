Fox Kids wins Broadcast Ratings
2001-02-20 02:26 UTC-8
Strong performances by shows like Digimon and Power Rangers have helped Fox Kids win an important victory over rivals ABC, Kids WB, and Nickelodeon. 
Saturday, February 10th, marked the second Saturday of the Neilsen Ratings February "sweeps".

For several weeks, unconfirmed rumors from Fox have hinted at a possible restructuring of the Fox Kids block, or even eliminating it entirely due to poor 
ratings and lack of advertiser interest.

With Kids aged 6-11, the 10:30 AM broadcast of Digimon edged out Kids WB's Pokémon. Digimon recieved a 5.0/17 share, while Pokémon recieved a 4.9/16 share. 
The 9:00 AM broadcast of Digimon also fared well, recieving a 4.7/18 share.

Fox Kids did almost as well with Kids 2-11, placing only fractions of a point behind Pokémon for both Digimon broadcasts.

What do these numbers mean?
(adapted from the Nielsen Media FAQ)

The 10:30AM Digimon broadcast (5.0/17) recieved a 5.0 rating, and a 17 share. The first number, the rating indicates how many television sets in the 
entire US were watching the show. 5.0 means around 5.0% of all televisions in the United States were tuned to Digimon during the broadcast. 
The second number, the share, indicates the number of televisions that were watching Digimon compared to the expected number of televisions that were 
turned on at the time. Thus, 17% of all viewers that were watching A Channel at 10:30AM were watching Digimon.

What are the 'sweeps'?
(adapted from the Nielsen Media FAQ)

Throughout the year, Neilsen Media Research takes a sampling of every TV market in the United States. The most important are February, May, July, 
and November in which data from all TV markets are collected. Historically, television companies use this data to price advertising time, 
as well as quality and duration of TV shows.
