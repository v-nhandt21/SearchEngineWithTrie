The Cycling Podcast Feminin – Women's Tour, stage five 

In the final Cycling Podcast Féminin from the OVO Energy Women’s Tour, Richard Moore, Orla Chennaoui and Rose Manley discuss the last stage and the battle for overall victory.

While the stage into Colwyn Bay was taken by Finnish champion Lotta Lepisto, it was Coryn Rivera, who has led since day two, who claimed the green jersey of champion. The first ever Women’s Tour winner, Marianne Vos, was second.

We hear from Lepisto, Rivera and Dani Rowe, who suffered a nasty crash the previous day but survived the stage to hold on to a place on the podium by finishing third.

There are also interviews with last year’s winner, Kasia Niewiadoma, and Dame Sarah Storey, who was there as a spectator and team owner and who shares her thoughts about how the Women’s Tour has developed in its five years.
