BILL BLOW EDF Energy to push up prices by 6 per cent – adding £70 a year to bills
This is the second rise for EDF Energy customers this year - but there's a way to cut the cost of your bills today
EDF ENERGY is to push up bills for the SECOND time this year putting further pressure on households facing rising gas and electricity costs.
From 31 August, 1.3million customers on its dual fuel tariff will pay 6 per cent more - adding £70 a year to bills.
In June the energy firm first hike prices by 1.4 per cent - adding £16 a year to bills.
In total, EDF customers will now pay £86 a more a year on average.
Energy bills vary based on where you live and how much energy your household uses.
The increase pushes up the average bill for an EDF duel fuel customer on the standard tariff to £1,228 a year.The energy firm blamed a rise of 18 per cent in the cost of wholesale energy since the start of the year for the rise.
Customers who are stuck on standard variable tariffs are often paying over the odds for energy bills.
Existing customers should now switch suppliers to save up to £300 a year.
In April, British Gas announced the second price hike in seven months for customers.and toys
Béatrice Bigois from EDF said said: “We know that another price rise will not be welcome, and we had hoped that our limited changes announced in April would be enough.
"However, energy costs have continued to rise significantly and despite our best efforts to absorb some of these by reducing the costs within our control – sadly we can no longer sustain this.
“Customers who wish to avoid this increase will be encouraged to choose one of our fixed price tariffs when we write to them later this month.”
