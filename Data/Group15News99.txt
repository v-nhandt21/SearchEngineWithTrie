BHA may revisit weighing-room scuffle that saw jockey banned for 21 days 

The British Horseracing Authority intimated that it may revisit the weighing-room incident at Goodwood on Sunday after which jockey Raul da Silva was given a 21-day ban for violent conduct.

On Monday, Jim Crowley, who needed stitches to a lip wound, spoke about the incident for the first time: “There was a minor disagreement over a race-riding incident with a number of jockeys not happy with Raul’s riding,” he said.

“After this, I was the victim of an unprovoked attack from behind with what felt like a piece of lead and it is disappointing I have been accused [by da Silva quoted in the Racing Post] of being the aggressor. This is categorically untrue and it is notable that only one of us was suspended.”

The BHA is reviewing the transcript from Sunday’s inquiry.

However, if more evidence becomes available or it deems a penalty too light it may reopen the inquiry.

The lead Crowley refers to is a thin flat bendable piece, usually weighing a pound, used by the valets to slot into weight cloths to make up a jockey’s allotted weight. There is usually a plentiful supply on the valets’ tables in the changing room.
