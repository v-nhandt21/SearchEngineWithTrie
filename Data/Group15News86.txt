BT Sport's presentation was slick, but Tyson Fury return was farcical and a dud fight is a dud fight 

Tyson Fury’s processional comeback victory over Sefer Seferi on Saturday was a red letter night for BT Sport’s fledgling boxing coverage. Like the Gyspy King himself, their performance is likely to prove divisive.

The broadcaster have hitched their wagon to part two of the Fury saga, signing a deal with promoter Frank Warren in 2016 that a ties in some of his other fighters such as Billy Joe Saunders and Carl Frampton.

The Fury redemption tale is alluring, but Saturday’s farcical four rounds showed that no matter how rich the human story, the sell is a hard one if the sport itself is not up to standard.
