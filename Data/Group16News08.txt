#NearMissToronto helps track close calls on the road
Abigail Pugh had just dropped her 9-year-old daughter off at school in Dufferin Grove when she witnessed a near miss.

A driver didn’t see a boy crossing at a pedestrian crosswalk and slammed on the brakes, narrowly avoiding another headline-making tragedy. The experience spurred Pugh to create the hashtag and ensuing campaign #NearMissToronto.
“Are you kidding me? They are devoting law enforcement resources to sting operations for this? There has to be higher priorities!” Avenatti said in another tweet, appearing to suggest a set-up. 


Daniels was topless when she “knowingly” touched a female Columbus police officer’s buttocks, placed her hands on the officer’s breast and then put her chest in the officer’s face while “on the premise of a sexually oriented business,” according to charging documents from the Franklin County Municipal Court obtained by WBNS.
A 2007 state law called the Community Defense Act prohibits dancers from touching customers and vice versa – excluding immediate family members.  

Although the law has been in effect for over a decade, a 2017 report from The Columbus Dispatch found that it is seldom enforced.

The porn star’s lawyer said the arrest “reeks of desperation,” and said Daniels was performing the same routine she had done “at nearly a hundred strip clubs” throughout the country.
