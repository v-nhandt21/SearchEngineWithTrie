MEGA FUN Celebrity Big Brother stars Shane Lynch and Dapper Laughs join the fun on The Cannon Run
70 cars that included two Bugatti Veyrons, a Liberty Walk Ferrari 458 Italia, McLaren 720S and BMW M5 Hamann, took part in a European adventure that was so epic it was renamed the Mega Run
IT was a case of I’m a celebrity, get me a car, and get me out of here, for The Cannon Run’s epic European adventure.
As fresh from the Celebrity Big Brother house was Daniel O'Reilly AKA, Dapper Laughs along with Boyzone star Shane Lynch.
Shane was also joined by his Monster Energy drifting buddies Steve Baggsy Biagioni and Buttsy Butler, as they took part in a crazy, two week road trip across Europe, with 70 cars crossing through ten countries.
The Cannon Run is the brainchild of Jay Cannon and his partner in crime, Alvin Harris, who have created the UK and Europe’s leading driving holiday company, where craic and cars are always guaranteed.
But that was only a few of the celebs who had signed up for the European adventure that was so epic, it was re-named — The Mega Run.
Olympic athlete, Derek Redmond bought an Aston Martin DB11 days before confirming his attendance, and MMA Fighter, Andrew Tate, AKA Cobra Tate, joined the convoy in the Cannon Run Porsche GT3.
The Mega Run kicked off in London, then made its way to Calais, and over the two week driving holiday they took in the sights and sounds of the Spa Racing Circuit and the Stuttgart Porsche museum.
They also go to see the picturesque Lake Como, the Maranello Ferrari Museum and party hotspots like Monaco, Barcelona, Valencia, Benidorm.
And to finish things off they wound down with four nights in Marbella!
And while in Spain they stopped off in Barcelona to catch up with Red Bull X-Fighter and Nitro Circus rider, Remi Bizouard and his MotoX training facility.
