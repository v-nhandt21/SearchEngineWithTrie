How to Make Trump’s Tax Returns Public
On June 14, the New York State attorney general, Barbara Underwood, filed a civil complaint against 
President Trump and his three oldest children, accusing them of “persistently illegal conduct” in 
using the Donald J. Trump Foundation as “little more than a checkbook for payments from Mr. Trump 
or his businesses to nonprofits, regardless of their purpose or legality.”
Ms. Underwood believes there is abundant evidence to bring criminal charges against Mr. Trump as 
well. She made that position very clear in the letters she sent to the Internal Revenue Service and 
the Federal Election Commission in Washington recommending “further investigation and legal action.”
Ms. Underwood sent those letters, at the same time she filed the civil complaint, because New York 
state law does not grant her automatic authority to initiate criminal investigations. Her criminal 
referral to Washington noted that it would be a crime for the president to interfere in such an 
investigation. However, given Mr. Trump’s assertion that he has the power to halt any criminal 
inquiry and to pardon himself for federal crimes, a criminal investigation by any part of the 
federal executive branch seems highly unlikely.
The attorney general could, however, easily gain that authority. All that’s needed is for Gov. Andrew 
Cuomo, the New York State Police or the state Department of Taxation and Finance to make a request, 
and the authority would be granted to her. Criminal jurisdiction also rests with Cyrus Vance Jr., 
the Manhattan district attorney. Mr. Vance has shown no interest, so far, in investigating other 
complaints against Mr. Trump.
