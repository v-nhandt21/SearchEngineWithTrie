A Huge Blind Spot : Why New York Asians Feel Overlooked
When Mayor Bill de Blasio proposed a change in the way students are admitted to the city’s most 
elite public high schools, he was surrounded by dozens of enthusiastic students, union leaders and 
elected officials, amid signs proclaiming “All Kids Deserve a Chance.”
Noticeably absent were representatives from one group that would be heavily affected by the change: 
Asian-Americans, whose children dominate those schools.
“This cliché of, ‘If you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu’ really felt like it rang true,” 
said Congresswoman Grace Meng, a Queens Democrat and graduate of one of the schools, Stuyvesant 
High School, who was not invited to the event last month. “I don’t think with any other community 
if there was such a large impact or sweeping change, they would not have been consulted or brought 
into the discussions.”
Asian-American community leaders say that in New York, far from being the “model minority” — a term 
many view as disparaging and inaccurate — they are the overlooked minority, taken for granted in 
the city’s calculus of political power.
It does not seem to matter, Asian-American officeholders and activists say, that all five 
Asian-American elected officials at the city, state and federal levels are Democrats, like Mr. de 
Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. Nor does it matter that Asian-Americans of all backgrounds, 
including East and South Asians, now make up almost 15 percent of the city’s population, with the 
total number up by more than half since 2000. Or that the number of Chinese and Korean registered 
voters has doubled over the same period, according to the Center for Urban Research at the CUNY 
Graduate Center.
“It’s not just one thing, and it’s not just one time,” said Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou, a Democrat 
who represents Chinatown and Lower Manhattan. “It shows a huge blind spot for Asian-American 
communities as a whole.”
