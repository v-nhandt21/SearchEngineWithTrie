RAPPER'S DELIGHT Spotify offers refunds to angry customers after annoying Drake music promo
SPOTIFY users fuming over the company's unrelenting promotion of Drake's new album are being offered refunds.
You may have noticed the rapper's face plastered over every single playlist on the service, including ones that didn't even feature his songs
Spotify claims this was to mark the release of his new double LP Scorpion and to celebrate his incredible run of breaking streaming records.
But enraged paying subscribers say the promo blitz counts as advertising, which they fork out £9.99 per month to avoid.
A crop of these users have now taken their complaints directly to Spotify with requests for refunds, according to Billboard.
Reddit user u/Schwagschwag first confirmed that he'd been compensated by the streaming service for the "Drake spam".
"I just messaged spotify customer service on their website and told them I wanted a refund since this is advertising and I pay for premium with no ads, and they have now refunded my last payment," he wrote in a post that has racked up over 22,000 likes.
"Complain, take your money back, and let them know you will cancel if they pull this sh*t again. Money talks. Money walking away talks," he added.
The Redditor also uploaded his chat transcript with a Spotify customer support assistant, in which the employee agreed with his issues and agreed to a refund.
"I understand you find this discomforting. Especially as a premium user," the Spotify worker admitted.
After an influx of complaints on Twitter, the company has also agreed to refund additional users.
It seems all you have to do is either get in touch with customer support here or direct message the @SpotifyCares Twitter account with email address you use to log-in to the service to get your £9.99 back.
We've reached out to Spotify for more info and will update this article with its response.
