Stephen Hawking funds charity lunch as his final gift to the people of Cambridge
While the funeral for Stephen Hawking was taking place in Cambridge, UK on Saturday, the legendary scientist's final gift was also well underway — a free Easter lunch to help hungry people in the city.
The meal was prepared by volunteers from the charity FoodCycle, who regularly supply free meals for those in poverty using surplus food.

On Saturday the food was provided by Hawking's family.
"Lucy Hawking contacted me and mentioned that the family would like to make a donation so that while the funeral was taking place people would be sitting down to a hot meal 'on Stephen'," East of England Regional Manager for FoodCycle, Alex Collis, explained to ITV.

"It was a really kind gesture that I think fitted well with the sympathy Prof Hawking felt for people who were having a tough time of things."
