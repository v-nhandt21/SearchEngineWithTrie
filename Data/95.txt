Hotels in Hanoi


Hanoi is the capital city of Vietnam. It has charmed many tourists who come for its elegant beauty twisted in the classic French colonial style and rhyme. Attractions in Hanoi are bountiful, ranging from the thousand-year-old Temple of Literature to the world heritage site Thang Long Ancient Citadel to the bustling Hanoi Old Quarter. With so many places to see and things to do, accommodation facilities in Hanoi have grown exponentially to meet the demand. There are five star hotels of international standard such as Sheraton Hotel and Sofitel Metropole Hanoi, the four stars and mid range one to meet the needs of family and group of friends, and of course myriad budget hotel options for less than $30 per night. Most hotels concentrate the Old Quarter, though more and more suites and luxury types are growing around Westlake, the expat area of Hanoi. The business district where many convention halls gather also has hotels of all star listings. Whichever you prefer, you know you will not be disappointed.
