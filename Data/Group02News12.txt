THE REAL DEAL
Ken Yamaoka, a third-generation Japanese-American, has all the qualifications of a presidential candidate: he studied at Yale, he fought in the Vietnam War, 
and he has been a Senator for several terms. Now, as he challenges Vice President Al Noah for the Democratic presidential nomination, 
he summons a young Japanese

journalist, Takashi Jo, to Washington, D.C. to cover his campaign. But Takashi soon discovers that he cannot be an impartial observer—he's Yamaoka's son out of wedlock! 
Intelligently written, exciting, critically acclaimed, Kaiji Kawaguchi combines an insider's attention to detail with a fascinating outsider's perspective on 
American politics.

In This Volume: A brilliant tactical turnaround during the first TV debate with Vice President Al Noah, 
Yamaoka narrowly wins his first primary in the vital state of New York. Now it's off to Texas to capture the second largest state in the country. 
But how well is an urbanite Asian Senator going to do in the heart of the Lone Star State? 
Especially when he goes for an unscheduled "town hall" meeting in a ranchers' honky-tonk? Then, the campaign moves to California, 
the nation's single most important state in the primaries. Yamaoka makes himself known in the Hollywood glamour circles while behind his back 
VP Albert Noah and his staff plot to derail Yamaoka by digging up a family scandal.
