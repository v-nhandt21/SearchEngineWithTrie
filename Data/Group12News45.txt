The Evolutionary Origin of Descending Testicles
Descending testicles were likely present in the earliest mammals, then subsequently disappeared in 
elephants, manatees and their relatives, according to a new study.
Reader, here’s an incomplete list of things you shouldn’t try with elephants: a memory contest, 
jump rope and castration. See, in addition to having uncanny recall and a firm relationship with 
gravity, elephants have their testicles nestled deep within their bodies, all the way up near their
 kidneys. That’s unusual: In most other mammals, testicles form during embryonic development near 
the kidneys and then descend, either to the lower abdomen or an external scrotum, by the time of 
a male’s birth.
Biologists have wondered about this discrepancy for decades. Did the earliest mammals retain their 
testicles, like elephants, or did they let their family jewels drop? A new study, published Thursday 
in PLOS Biology, says it was the latter. Studying the DNA of 71 mammals, a German team concluded 
that testicular descent is an ancestral trait that was later lost in so-called afrotherians, a 
ragtag group that includes elephants, manatees and several insect-eaters that live in or originated 
from Africa.
In four afrotherian subgroups — manatees and dugongs, elephant shrews, golden moles and tenrecs 
(small insectivores that resemble hedgehogs) — the authors found nonfunctional remnants of two 
genes specifically involved in testicular descent.
Scientists often rely on geologic fossils to piece together evolutionary history, but this study 
shows that there is also a “fossil record in the genome,” said Mark Springer, a biology professor 
at the University of California, Riverside, who was not involved in the research.
