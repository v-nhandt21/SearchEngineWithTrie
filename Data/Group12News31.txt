Henry Butler is death
Henry Butler, a pianist who carried the flamboyant, two-fisted traditions of New Orleans to the 
brink of the avant-garde, died on Monday in a hospice facility in the Bronx. He was 69.
His death was confirmed by his manager, Art Edelstein. Mr. Butler, who had lived in Brooklyn since 
2009, had been treated for metastic colon cancer.
Mr. Butler's music was encyclopedic, precise and wild. He was acclaimed as a member of a distinctively 
New Orleans piano pantheon alongside Jelly Roll Morton, James Booker, Tuts Washington, Professor 
Longhair, Fats Domino, Allen Toussaint and Dr. John. He was also a forthright, bluesy singer who 
often used New Orleans standards as springboards for improvisation.
Mr. Butler commanded the syncopated power and splashy filigree of boogie-woogie and gospel and 
the rolling polyrhythms of Afro-Caribbean music. He could also summon the elegant delicacy of c
lassical piano or hurtle toward the dissonances and atonal clusters of modern jazz. He could play 
in convincing vintage styles and sustain multileveled counterpoint, then demolish it all in a 
whirlwind of genre-smashing virtuosity.
