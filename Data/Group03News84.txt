WHEN young people make it on to the property ladder it's usually as part of a couple.
But what if you don't have a significant other?
With the average first-time buyer needing £33,000 and the average house price hitting £207,693 it might seem like an impossible feat for those going alone.
Government schemes like Shared Ownership make it a bit easier, but you co-own the property with the housing association and must pay rent on the bit that's not yours.
You can buy anything from 25 per cent to 75 percent of the property, and you can increase the amount you own over time.
But some developers also offer similar private, shared equity schemes where they allow you to buy only a portion of the home to help you get on the property ladder.
And whilst it means that they will own a stake in your home, there won't be any loan repayments.
This week in the My First Home series, we caught up with Amélie Arras, 26, who used a shared equity scheme to buy a two-bed flat for £168,999 in Chichester after she split up with her boyfriend.
Who said singletons can't go it alone, eh?
When did you buy your home and how much did you pay?
Prior to buying my own home, I lived in a rental flat with my boyfriend. When we split up in November 2017, I decided it was time to buy my own place.
I’d viewed a couple of houses in my price-range beforehand and they all needed so much work.
