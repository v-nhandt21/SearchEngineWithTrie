'EVIL GENIUS' Mum shocked to find ‘chilling’ note inside homework of daughter, 7, threatening to ‘poison’ and ‘destroy’ family

Stephanie Furneaux, 33, from Cornwall, got the shock of her life when she read what her child had written

A MUM was shocked to spot a chilling message from her “lovely” seven-year-old daughter while browsing through her homework.

Stephanie Furneaux, 33, discovered her eldest Poppy had creepily penned “in March I found poison to destroy you” in a exercise book after being tasked with making a sentence out of a list of words.

The mum-of-two said she burst out laughing when she first read the ominous message and then started to feel a bit worried – yet admitted she was impressed by the schoolgirl's creative writing skills.

Stephanie, from Gunnislake, Cornwall, said: “I was thinking ‘maybe my child is an evil genius.

“I'm not locking my bedroom door at night though, she's a lovely girl really so I'm sure I'm safe.”

The words Poppy were given for the writing exercise were January, February, March, knock, knitting, destroy, royal and poison.

The homework instructions read: “Now practise your spellings by writing some of your spelling words in sentences.”

Microbiologist Stephanie said: “I texted my husband James and I think he was a bit more sensible about it.

“He pointed out she didn't have that many words to make a sentence from so from what she was given she did a good job.

“I haven't mentioned anything to her about it, I just think it was clever of her to make a sentence from it."
